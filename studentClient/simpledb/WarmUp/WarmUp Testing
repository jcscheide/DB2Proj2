The correct way to go through the warm up package is the following.

First create the tables by running warm up

Adding a patient:
Run SelectAllPatientsFromDoctorID
Then run AddPatient
Then run SelectAllPatientsFromDoctorID again, notice there is another patient

Changing Doctor Departments
Run SelectAllDoctorsFromDept
then run ChangeDept
then run SelectAllDoctorsFromDept again, notice that the department has another doctor

Done.
